# What I’m Doing Now

## Location

- Based in [location]. Working remotely.

## What I'm Focusing On

- **Developing:** Working on minimal, accessible web apps—personal sites, tools, and open source projects. My main project right now is evolving this site and its Hugo theme for better performance and clarity.
- **Learning:** Exploring new web technologies and frameworks, plus going deeper into backend topics (Go, databases, serverless architectures).
- **Music:** Producing original tracks in my spare time, tinkering with sound design and mixing.
- **Reading:** Picking up more nonfiction and staying updated on programming best practices.
- **Personal:** Prioritizing well-being—daily walks, journaling, and learning how to cook a few more good meals.

## What I'm Not Doing

- Not taking on new freelance projects.
- Not using social media much.
- Limiting notifications and multitasking.

## Why a Now Page?

Instead of a list of past work, a now page gives a snapshot of my current priorities—what's most meaningful to me _right now_. You can learn more about the idea at [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).
