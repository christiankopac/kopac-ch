A story that might remind more than one person, or at least my nephew, to young Werther's story of obsession[^1].

Drawn within the context of a rapper and it's crew, the film cover topis of sexuality, queerness and obsession towards a music idol. Who hasn't been there, believing some humans are simply above the rest, when in reality, where all the same. Media, it's your fault, but fame those wonders too.

Nice shots, a bit of a lo-fi aesthetic an a very easy going drama throughout the movie between the singer and his fan film-maker. Obsession might drive you crazy, but it is almost always possible to see the other side of the coin.
