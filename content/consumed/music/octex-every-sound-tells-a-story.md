If you're into some of the more classic and by-the-books lessons of Dub Techno, this album is a must-listen. Released the same year as Monolake's _Silence_[^1] and just four years after some of Rhythm & Sound’s most iconic work[^2], it shows how ahead of his time Octex really was—the sound feels timeless.

_I had the pleasure of listening to him live a few years ago at Sajeta[^3]. After overcoming some technical difficulties, he delivered a sublime set. That festival was a highlight, especially after the od:vod x Sajeta collaboration[^4], where I performed with my good friend evano[^5]._
