Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools, but they excel in different scenarios.

## When to Use Flexbox

Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts - either rows or columns.

## When to Use Grid

Grid shines with two-dimensional layouts where you need control over both rows and columns.
