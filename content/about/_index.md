## About Me

Christian Kopač is a software developer, music producer, and lifelong learner based in [location]. With a passion for building elegant solutions to complex problems, Christian works across the full stack—from frontend interfaces to backend systems.

## What I Do

- **Software Development**: Building web applications, APIs, and tools
- **Music Production**: Creating beats, mixing tracks, and exploring sound design
- **Writing**: Sharing knowledge and experiences through technical writing

## This Site

This site serves as a digital garden where I share:
- Technical posts and tutorials
- Music projects and production notes
- Collections of tools, resources, and learnings
- Media consumption logs (books, movies, etc.)

### Design Philosophy

The site embraces the **smolweb** philosophy—prioritizing accessibility, minimal JavaScript, and small file sizes. Images use dithering to reduce bandwidth while maintaining visual interest.

### Runes

This theme uses Elder Futhark runes as semantic symbols throughout the interface. Each rune is chosen for its traditional meaning:

- **ᛉ Algiz** (Protection, Time) — Marks dates in posts, directors in movie reviews
- **ᛋ Sowilo** (Sun, Energy) — Indicates word count in posts, year in movie reviews
- **ᛏ Tiwaz** (Victory, Honor) — Shows reading time in posts, ratings in movie reviews
- **ᛞ Dagaz** (Day, Breakthrough) — Denotes tags and topics
- **ᚠ Fehu** (Wealth, Abundance) — Marks categories and collections
- **ᛁ Isaz** (Ice, Stillness) — Used for informational notes and calm observations
- **ᛏ Tiwaz** (Victory, Honor) — Marks tips and helpful guidance
- **ᚨ Ansuz** (Communication, Wisdom) — Highlights important information
- **ᚹ Wunjo** (Joy/Warning) — Indicates warnings and cautions
- **ᚢ Uruz** (Strength, Primal Force) — Signals critical cautions and outdated content
- **ᚱ Raido** (Journey, Movement) — Represents the table of contents (navigation through text)
- **ᛟ Odal** (Heritage, Home) — Marks featured content

These symbols provide visual hierarchy while respecting smolweb constraints (no emoji, minimal Unicode overhead).
