Winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes, *Anatomy of a Fall* is a gripping courtroom drama that keeps you guessing until the very end. The film masterfully dissects not just a mysterious death, but an entire marriage.

Sandra Hüller delivers a phenomenal performance as a woman accused of murdering her husband. The ambiguity and moral complexity make this one of the best films of 2023.
